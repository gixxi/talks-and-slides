# prolog-to-corelogic

## Synopsis 
This projects aims to give an introduction to both prolog as well as logical programming using clojure's core.logic. core.logic is prolog-like constraint-base, nominal logic as well as relation programming within clojure. 
  
 The examples within the wikipedia article on prolog http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog_(Programmiersprache) are translated into clojure.core providing both an indroduction both in clojure's most important syntax elements and control structures as well as in the main idea behind functional and logical programming.
